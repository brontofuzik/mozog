NeuralNetwork -- To-do list
===========================

H = High, M = Medium, L = Low

* [H] Provide more specific exception in the BackpropagationLayer class' constructor.
      Notes: See the BackpropagationNeuron class' constructor.
      
* [H] Experiment with hybrid training.
      Notes: www.HeatonResearch.com
      
* [H] Experiment with oraganizational dynamics (prunning).
      Notes: See section "Prunning" in notebook.

* [M] Add network2array CODEC.
      Notes: www.HeatonResearch.com
      
* [M] Experiment with neuron-unique gains.
      Notes: See section "Volba strmosti" in notebook.
      
* [M] Experiment with adaptive learning rate.
      Notes: See section "Doporucenie pre rychlost ucenia" and
                 section "Heuristiky pre rychlost ucenia" in notebook.

* [L] Add serialization support.
